Here's a code snippet that processes a CSV file, loads its contents into an Oracle database table, records a summary in a summary table, and creates a backup file in a separate "bak" directory:

```python
import os
import csv
import cx_Oracle
import datetime

# Function to load CSV data into Oracle table
def load_csv_to_oracle(file_path):
    connection = cx_Oracle.connect("username/password@hostname:port/service_name")
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Open CSV file for reading
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        csv_data = csv.reader(file)
        
        # Process each row in the CSV file
        for row in csv_data:
            # Insert row into Oracle table
            cursor.execute("INSERT INTO your_table_name (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (:1, :2, ...)", row)

    cursor.close()
    connection.commit()
    connection.close()

# Function to record summary in summary table
def record_summary(file_name, total_records, successfully_loaded, failed_records):
    connection = cx_Oracle.connect("username/password@hostname:port/service_name")
    cursor = connection.cursor()

    # Get current date and time
    current_date = datetime.datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S")

    # Insert summary data into Oracle table
    cursor.execute("INSERT INTO summary_table (file_name, total_records, successfully_loaded, failed_records, date) "
                   "VALUES (:1, :2, :3, :4, :5)",
                   (file_name, total_records, successfully_loaded, failed_records, current_date))

    cursor.close()
    connection.commit()
    connection.close()

# Function to create a backup file
def create_backup(file_path):
    # Get file name without extension
    file_name = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(file_path))[0]

    # Create backup directory if it doesn't exist
    backup_dir = "bak/"
    if not os.path.exists(backup_dir):
        os.makedirs(backup_dir)

    # Create backup file path
    backup_path = os.path.join(backup_dir, file_name + ".bak")

    # Create backup file
    os.rename(file_path, backup_path)

# Main function
def main(file_path):
    # Check if backup file exists
    file_name = os.path.splitext(os.path.basename(file_path))[0]
    backup_file = "bak/" + file_name + ".bak".path.exists(backup_file):
        print("Backup file already exists. Skipping processing.")
    else:
        # Load CSV data into Oracle table
        load_csv_to_oracle(file_path)

        # Record summary in summary table
        total_records =  # provide the logic to calculate total records
        successfully_loaded =  # provide the logic to calculate successfully loaded records
        failed_records =  # provide the logic to calculate failed records

        record_summary(file_name, total_records, successfully_loaded, failed_records)

        # Create backup file
        create_backup(file_path)

# Example usage
file_path = "your_csv_file.csv"
main(file_path)
```

Note: Replace `"username/password@hostname:port/service_name"` with your actual Oracle database connection string. Additionally, make sure to fill in the commented sections with the appropriate logic for calculating the total records, successfully loaded records, and failed records.

Please adjust the code as per your specific requirements and replace the table names (`your_table_name` and `summary_table`) accordingly.
